`react-photo-view` has an unparalleled preview interaction experience: starting from the opening of the image, the animation, details and interaction of each frame have been carefully designed and repeatedly debugged, which is comparable to the effect of native image preview.

        <img src="/1-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" />
      </PhotoView>
    </PhotoProvider>
  );
}
